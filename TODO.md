# TODO

## Basic functionality
◻️ fix the awkward extra pages

◻️ alphabetize entries

◻️ page numbers in indices

◻️ song range

◻️ song author looks better

◻️ ...tests?

## Aesthetics
◻️ make indices not be ugly

◻️ indices don't need to show up in TOC

◻️ a nice cover image or something

## Bells and whistles
◻️ better input format than a CSV -- maybe it can pull from my google spreadsheet?

◻️ separate topic tags from core attribute tags, and have icons in the TOC/song title for the latter

◻️ "by trad" isn't right
