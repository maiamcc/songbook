# Songbook
## Generating lyric-books, for nerds

### The Vision
1. song information set forth in a CSV: title, author, and so on, plus the path to a file containing song lyrics, and some categories: happy? sad? sea chantey? easy-to-pick-up chorus?
2. lyric files for every song
3. a simple command the run the program, and BAM:
4. a shiny pdf (generated with LaTeX) of all of your song lyrics, plus a table of contexts and indexes by all of the categories you specified in the CSV, all with clickable links that bring you to the approriate song.
5. ???
6. profit!
