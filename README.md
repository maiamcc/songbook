## Generating folk song lists and indices

I want to know what songs are in my collection, and what they're like. What if I could programmatically generate an organized list(s) of rep by title, mood, etc. to stick in my songbook?

### The Vision
1. song attributes set forth in a CSV: for each song, note whether it belongs to a limited handful of categories
2. simple Python script to compile the CSV into a shiny LaTeX doc
4. the generated LaTex document will contain a master list of all known songs + their attributes, plus lists for each individual attribute.
5. ???
6. profit!
